# COL216 Computer Architecture Assignments
This repository is relevent to the course **COL216 (COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE)** by Prof. **PREETI RANJAN PANDA, *IIT Delhi***.

## Assignments
- Assingment0: Downloading and installing **QtSpim** (MIPS Simulator) for further assignments on MIPS Assembly Language.
- Assignment1: Gaining experience to MIPS Assembly Language and MIPS Assembly Program.
- Assingment2: MIPS Assembly Program to emulate a two-player **Tic-Tac-Toe** game.
- Assignment3: Design of simple **MIPS Processor** to execute basic instructions or R and I type in **VHDL**.
- Assignment4: **Simulate** and **synthesize** the Processor of Assignment3 using Vivado and test on the FPGA Basys3 board. 
- Assignment5: Include **branch** and **jump** instructions in the Assingment4.
- Assignment6: **Simulate** and **synthesize** the Processor of Assignment5 using Vivado and test on the FPGA Basys3 board.
- Assignment7: Build **MULTICYCLE Processor** (not Pipelined) in **C++**.
- Assignment8: Extend the processor in Assignment7 using **pipeline**. **Stall** the Processor in case of hazards.
- Assignment9: Implementing **forwarding** in Assignment8 to increase its efficiency.
- Assignment10: Introduce **Cache level hierarchy** to get HIT or MISS while accessing the Main Memory.
- Assignment11: Design a simulation for **Floating Point Adder** in C++.
- Assignment12: Design a simulation for **cache memory**.

## Attention
If this code is one of your assignments, I strictly recommend you to try it out first by yourself and then come and have a look, if needed. Otherwise, feel free to use it if you want to expand the language or for any other purpose.
## MOSS
**IIT Delhi** uses a tool named **MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity)** to detect similarity in code. **Please don't simply copy the code**, instead go through the code and try to understand the program flow. But still, if you are copying the code from here, make sure to build sufficient changes or prepare to fail if caught.
