# COL216 Computer Architecture Assignments
This repository is relevent to the course **COL216 (COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE)** by Prof. **PREETI RANJAN PANDA, *IIT Delhi***.

## Assignments
- Assingment0: Downloading and installing QtSpim (MIPS Simulator) for further assignments on MIPS Assembly Language.
- Assignment1: Gaining experience to MIPS Assembly Language and MIPS Assembly Program.
- Assingment2: MIPS Assembly Program to emulate a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Attention
If this code is one of your assignments, I strictly recommend you to try it out first by yourself and then come and have a look, if needed. Otherwise, feel free to use it if you want to expand the language or for any other purpose.
### MOSS
IIT Delhi uses a tool named MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) to detect similarity in code, even though it will be hard to detect copying while working with OCaml given that it's a less-typed functional programming language, and more or less there will always be a similarity around 30%. But still, if you are copying the code from here, make sure to build sufficient changes or prepare to fail if caught.
