# COL216 Computer Architecture Assignments
This repository is relevent to the course **COL216 (COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE)** by Prof. **PREETI RANJAN PANDA, *IIT Delhi***.

## Assignments
- Assingment0: Downloading and installing QtSpim (MIPS Simulator) for further assignments on MIPS Assembly Language.
- Assignment1: Gaining experience to MIPS Assembly Language and MIPS Assembly Program.
- Assingment2: MIPS Assembly Program to emulate a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Attention
If this code is one of your assignments, I strictly recommend you to try it out first by yourself and then come and have a look, if needed. Otherwise, feel free to use it if you want to expand the language or for any other purpose.
## MOSS
IIT Delhi uses a tool named MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) to detect similarity in code. Please don't simply copy the code, instead go through the code and try to understand the program flow. But still, if you are copying the code from here, make sure to build sufficient changes or prepare to fail if caught.
